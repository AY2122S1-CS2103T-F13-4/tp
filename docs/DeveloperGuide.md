### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the tuitione data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the tuitione data i.e., all `Lesson` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueLessonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Lesson` objects (e.g., results of a filter) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Lesson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Remark` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Student` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Remark` object per unique remark, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Remark` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/tuitione/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both tuitione data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TuitioneStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

### Filter feature

#### Implementation

The filter operation is facilitated by `FilterCommand` and `FilterCommandParser`. `FilterCommandParser` first parses the user
input to extract out the command and the arguments, after which the `FilterCommand#execute(model)` method is invoked in
the `LogicManager` class to filter the `filteredStudents` and/or the `filteredLessons` list(s) in the `model` based on the given user inputs.
The filter performs differently based on the inputs given (grade, subject, or both):
* If only grade is given as input, TuitiONE filters both the student list and the lesson list based on the given grade.
* If only subject is given as input, TuitiONE filters only the lesson list based on the given subject.
* If both are given as input, TuitiONE filters the student list by the given grade, but filters the lesson list based
on both the given grade and subject.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter operation works.

Step 1: The user launches the app with the stored student list holding the initial student data and the lesson list holding the
initial lesson data in TuitiONE (only the fields of each object relevant to filter are shown in the diagrams below).
![FilterState0](images/FilterState0.png)

Step 2: The user executes `filter g/S2 s/English`  to filter out S2 English lessons and S2 students. The `filter` command causes
the `FilterCommand#execute(model)` method to be called which then filters the respective lists to only show the relevant objects.
![FilterState1](images/FilterState1.png)

Step 3: The user executes `list` to get back the initial lists before the filter. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FilterCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the filter command:
![FilterActivityDiagram](images/FilterActivityDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to implement filter**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: one filter command that handles both grade and subject filtering
    * Pros: Less commands to remember, user will not feel overwhelmed.
    * Cons: Slightly more difficult to implement, as one command has to handle the 3 cases of user input as mentioned above.
* **Alternative 2**: 3 separate filter commands, one for each scenario stated above
    * Pros: Slightly more straightforward to implement.
    * Cons: Too many existing commands in the application, and may not be as intuitive to use.

Command syntax: `filter [g/GRADE] [s/SUBJECT]`

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedTuitione`. It extends `Tuitione` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `tuitioneStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedTuitione#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current tuitione state in its history.
* `VersionedTuitione#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous tuitione state from its history.
* `VersionedTuitione#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone tuitione state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitTuitione()`, `Model#undoTuitione()` and `Model#redoTuitione()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedTuitione` will be initialized with the initial tuitione state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single tuitione state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th student in the tuitione. The `delete` command calls `Model#commit**Tuitione**()`, causing the modified state of the tuitione after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `tuitioneStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted tuitione state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitTuitione()`, causing another modified tuitione state to be saved into the `tuitioneStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitTuitione()`, so the tuitione state will not be saved into the `tuitioneStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoTuitione()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous tuitione state, and restores the tuitione to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Tuitione state, then there are no previous Tuitione states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoTuitione()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoTuitione()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the tuitione to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `tuitioneStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest tuitione state, then there are no undone Tuitione states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoTuitione()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the tuitione, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitTuitione()`, `Model#undoTuitione()` or `Model#redoTuitione()`. Thus, the `tuitioneStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitTuitione()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `tuitioneStateList`, all tuitione states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire tuitione.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of student details in a tuition centre
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Provide a more streamlined platform, as compared to conventional excel which might have numerous irrelevant functions. This platform also offers a more intuitive UI - with a clean and minimalist layout. Helps manage student admin information faster than a typical mouse-driven app. The app is only used for one tuition centre.
