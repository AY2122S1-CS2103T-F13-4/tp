**TuitiONE** is a _desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface_ (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, TuitiONE can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [r/REMARK]` can be used as `n/John Doe r/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[r/REMARK]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `r/sick`, `r/absent r/graduated` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PARENT_CONTACT`, `p/PARENT_CONTACT n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
